Firstly I want to say, it was an honor to play with all of you.  Classic wow has been a great time for me and I've thoroughly enjoyed the last year.
That said, I'm done with the guild mostly due to the officers.  Most of the remaining officers are some of the worst players / decision makers I've ever met;
these people should not be in a position of leadership, and they're only there because of nepotism.  These people are so incompetent that regular members like myself, Dill, Prestige, etc. had to step up and lead the guild to its current (IMO pretty good) state.  However, these remaining officers still hold strong, and really stupid ideas that
they feel they need to push because of their titles (eg. r1 / r2 are in a pretty good state, each can clear Naxx individually, but for some reason they want to fuse the rosters
for Naxx and force 40 people to miss loot and progression first week).  I'm pretty tired of dealing with all this and I don't see the situation really changing due to how 
entrenched these remaining officers are.  It's quite tragic that our journey together ended like this, but at least this should provide some clarity to those who care about the why.

Take care everyone!
